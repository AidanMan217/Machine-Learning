# Machine-Learning
Mini-projects I work on to learn machine learning, statistics/probability, and optimization.

Blood Transfusion: I implemented Linear Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent as I have learned from class (Math 156 @ UCLA)

Banana Quality: Another toy dataset in which I implemented Ridge Regression, feature scaling (Normalization), and SGD as I have learned from class
